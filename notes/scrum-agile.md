## Scrum agile

Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together.

### Sprint

A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work.
Sprint lasts often 2 weeks.
In scrum, the team work is divided in sprints.

### Sprint cycle

1. [sprint planning](#sprint-planning)
2. [sprint activity (daily scrum or standups)](#daily-standup)
3. [sprint review](#iteration-review)
4. [sprint retrospective](#retrospective)

### Sprint planning

Sprint planning is an event in scrum that kicks off the sprint. 
The purpose of sprint planning is to define **what can be delivered** in the sprint and how that **work will be achieved**.

### Daily standup

Stand-up is designed to quickly inform everyone of what's going on across the team.
Have each team member answers the following questions:

- What did I complete yesterday?
- What will I work on today?
- Am I blocked by anything?

### Iteration review

Iteration review is a time to showcase the work of the team.

### Retrospective

Agile is about getting rapid feedback to make the product and development culture better. 
Retrospectives help the team understand what worked wellâ€“and what didn't.
